Three apps for the system under `_build/<profile_name>/rel/<app_name>`. Copy them to the production server.

First start the middleman:
```console
cd middleman/bin
./middleman start
```

Second start the session:
```console
cd session_server/bin
./session_server start
```

Third start the http:
```console
cd http/bin
./http start
```

Then start the im:

cd im/bin
./im start
```


By default the logs of the system are in `/tmp/log/`, the config of each app are in `simple_im/config/<app_name>/sys.config`.
